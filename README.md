# NCAA March Madness Tournament 2019
This project uses linear regression, bootstrapping, and other statistical methods to analyze data from the 2019 NCAA March Madness Tournament.
Comparisons are drawn between a team's seed, rank, ADJOE (Adjusted Offensive Efficiency), and ADJDE (Adjusted Defensive Efficiency).
An algorithm is created to predict a team's tournament rank and is found to be more accurate at prediction than the official NCAA seed.
